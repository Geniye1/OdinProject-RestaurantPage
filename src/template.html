                        The food at Good Food: Bar and Grill is light years ahead of any other restaurant that dares open at the same
                        time as us, anywhere on the planet. We often get questioned how we are so sure we have the best food, well how 
                        about you take a look at the giant 'F' on our front window? We've been awarded that by the Chicago health department 
                        every year for 10 consecutive years. 'F'. For 'Fantastic.'

                            Our most popular item, a mix of our "homemade" guacamole and a fully loaded Glock 9mm pistol. Taste how
                            the metal of the barrel compliments the avocado taste. Be careful eating it though, 4 people have died
                            after they accidentally pressed the trigger.

                            My greatest invention: a slice cheese pizza topped with Lucky Charm's marshmellows, served with a can of Guiness
                            and one raw potato. Someone was so impressed they passed out last week in the restaurant - the paramedics said
                            something about a 'diabetic coma,' I don't know what that is but it sounds like he really enjoyed it! May
                            he rest in peace.

                <h1>Chef Nutsak</h1>
                <p>
                    Yes, I know my name what my name sounds like. But, have I let it slow me down? Immensely. My entire life has
                    been balls on my locker, balls on my face, balls in my dreams - my entire life has been tormented by these sacks of 
                    barely functioning sperm. But through it all, I cultivated a love for food derived purely from spite. I knew
                    one day I would show all those simpletons I was more than just a homonym. It was during the most depressive period
                    of my life that I discovered my secret sauce. Rich, creamy, the face of opulence: I struck gold. And the moment I 
                    got my 'F' I knew I had done it. I called my parents who were unusually reserved, but no matter. I knew I had finally
                    achieved my dream.
