                        The food at Good Food: Bar and Grill is light years ahead of any other restaurant that dares open at the same
                        time as us, anywhere on the planet. We often get questioned how we are so sure we have the best food, well how 
                        about you take a look at the giant 'F' on our front window? We've been awarded that by the Chicago health department 
                        every year for 10 consecutive years. 'F'. For 'Fantastic.'

                            The dish that made the mayor of Chicago cry, my secret sauce elevates the flavor of the toast to
                            heights that you don't even know is possible.

                            Our most popular item, a mix of our "homemade" guacamole and a fully loaded Glock 9mm pistol. Taste how
                            the metal of the barrel compliments the avocado taste. Be careful eating it though, 4 people have died
                            after they accidentally pressed the trigger.

                            My greatest invention: a slice cheese pizza topped with Lucky Charm's marshmellows, served with a can of Guiness
                            and one raw potato. Someone was so impressed they passed out last week in the restaurant - the paramedics said
                            something about a 'diabetic coma,' I don't know what that is but it sounds like he really enjoyed it! May
                            he rest in peace.
